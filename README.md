University of Michigan - Applied Text Mining in Python

## This note we aim to study text mining and I found interesting of text mining applications from the course examples including medical records and social media as sources.

## 🧸💬 String matching method
```
for idx, item in enumerate(doc) :
    item = item.strip();
    match_string_one = r"((?:\d{1,2})(?:(?:\/|-)\d{1,2})(?:(?:\/|-)\d{2,4}))";
    answer_one = re.search(match_string_one, item);
```

## 🧸💬 String matching results - transform of a datetime data fields for a filter.
